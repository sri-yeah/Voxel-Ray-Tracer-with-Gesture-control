# Voxel Ray Tracer with Gesture Control

This project started as a Python model for a hardware ray tracer implemented on an FPGA. This model has been extended to include a GUI and gesture control, as well as updates/rewrites to all of the included files. 

By holding up 2 fingers, the user can control their position within the world space by dragging. By holding up 5 fingers, the user can call the render function to regenerate the image. 


Attatched in the MemoryFiles folder are example memory files of the new Imperial College London logo.
